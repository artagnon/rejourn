OUTLINE
-------
Rejourn is a static site generator for programmers. Just write an
article in a markup language of your choice, and some metadata
information like author/ date; rejourn takes care of the rest.

Dependencies:
* Mako Python bindings
* Markdown Python bindings [optional: for markdown rendering]
* Nose [optional: for running included tests]

Features:
* Markdown and Asciidoc. It can easily be extended to support more
  markup languages- simply write a tranform function and add it to the
  'htransform_mapper' in 'util.py'.
* Dependencies handled by Makefile. This means that an output HTML
  file will not be built unless and until the corresponding input file
  changes.
* Drafts. The 'draft' metadata header controls whether the output
  should be built.
* Static pages. For pages in the toplevel index like "About
  me". Controlled by 'draft' metadata header.
* Configurable views. The template to render with the given content is
  controlled by a simple 'view_mapper' in 'util.py'.
* Tags. You can assign associate multiple freeform tags to a single
  article, and view all articles with a certain tag. Controlled by
  'tags' metadata header.
* Cache. No article is ever unnecessarily rebuilt- the content is
  hashed and stored in the 'cache' subdirectory to recall at a later
  time. This is especially useful when the site has many tags.
* RSS 2.0 feed. Built by default- no extra configuration required.

USAGE
-----
Modify core.cfg to set the indir and outdir. Run the `configure`
script to generate the Makefile; then run `make` to produce the actual
HTML pages in outdir. Run `make test` to run the included tests.

When an existing input file is modified, run `make` to update the
output file. When the Makefile needs to be regenerated to build new
input files, run the `configure` script to regenerate it.
