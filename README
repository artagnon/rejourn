OUTLINE
-------
Rejourn is a static HTML generation engine written in Python. It
primarily serves to host a programmer's journal. As a result, it
leaves out common features that other blog engines concentrate on,
and includes only very niche ones.

Dependencies:
* Mako
* Nose
* Markdown

USAGE
-----
Modify core.cfg to set the indir and outdir. Run the configure script
to generate the Makefile; then run `make` to produce the actual HTML
pages in outdir. Run `make test` to run the included tests.
